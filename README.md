# DON'T USE THIS
UNLESS YOU WANT A BRAIN CANCER, WAIT TILL I'LL BE DONE WITH FIXING STUFF AND WRITING A GOOD README.

The current code style can't even be called a code style, there's a lot of api errors and too much code duplicates.
Not to mention the intervals.

I wanted to finish this tonight and push this shit publicly so I won't stop until this project is finished.

Right now you'll probably get banned from Discord and blacklisted on Dank Memer.
